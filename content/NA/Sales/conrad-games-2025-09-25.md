### Work decomposition by component

#### Game Engine Backend

- Requirements and design
  - Define wallet model and session lifecycle; define idempotency rules and transaction atomicity.
  - Design API contract (OpenAPI): CreateSession, GetBalance, Bet, Win, Refund, Admin endpoints.
- Data model and persistence
  - Tables: sessions, wallet_transactions, bet_log.
  - Wallet semantics and transactions
  - Idempotency keys for repeated requests.
- Game math engine
  - Implement pluggable math interface: RNG mode, scripted payout tables (for debug and tests).
- APIs and integration
  - REST endpoints with clear error codes and retries.
  - Logging and audit
  - Immutable append-only outcomes_log with timestamp, input, RNG seed, and derived outcome.
  - Exportable CSV/JSON reports for audit.
- Testing
  - Unit tests for math strategies.
- Deliverable
  - Dockerized service, OpenAPI spec.

#### Game Frontend

- UX and design
  - High-fidelity slot UI from designer assets: reels, buttons, balance, bet controls.
  - Touch-first layout and accessible controls.
- Rendering and animation
  - Use Canvas (PixiJS) for performant reels.
  - Audio engine for SFX and music with mute controls.
- Integration
  - Connect to session and wallet APIs; handle network errors gracefully.
  - Implement optimistic UI: show spin animation immediately, reconcile with server response.
- Local resilience
  - Short network disconnect handling: queue UI actions, reconcile on reconnect, show status.
- Testing
  - Playtests, cross-browser checks, mobile/tablet screen testing in kiosk mode.
- Deliverable
  - Static bundle on CDN, integration tests, accessibility audit.

#### Game Launcher

- Landing page and session creation
  - Simple page to pick FUN amount, start session on the kiosk device.
  - Kiosk config: auto-fullscreen, disable navigation, inactivity timeout.
- Deliverable
  - Static bundle.

#### Cross-cutting tasks

- CI/CD and infra
  - container images, pipeline to deploy staging and prod.
- Observability
  - Metrics, logs.
- Documentation
  - API docs (OpenAPI),  deployment guide, kiosk setup.
- QA and testing

### Acceptance criteria for MVP

- Successful end-to-end flow: kiosk creates session, user bets FUN, spin resolves, wallet updated, and logs written.
- Monitoring and alerting configured for errors and anomalous payout metrics.
