Goal: describe the main steps of development process.

## 1. Discovery phase
We need to test which CDN provides in Asia will work with HLS video steam without broken stream, which latency will be there (is it actually ok to play within it, or not).
Also, we need to create a documentation for dealer, mocks for all system parts (like dealer screen, user screen etc.)

## 2. Building rails 
We need to establish CI/CD for all system components, add test environments for all parts of system. Test video streaming.

## 3. Build game engine
We need to build an API to launch and manage game sessions. Client to cover common cases (block money, bet\win\refund, unblock money). Also, the actual outcomes are coded here.

##  4. Build client modules
We need to build integrations with HID, and with screens inside the studio, to provide info to dealer.

## 5. Testing and analytics
We need to test everything, lost of testing. Also, we need to create reporting engine and alerts here.
