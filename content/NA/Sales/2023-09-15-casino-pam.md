As far we understand from the call you want to build a new platform, targeting mostly LATAM and Africa Geo. We discussed that you want to build Player Management System (CRM for players). 
We got [that document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iDMjngB6uqM3Zheg8BT8aA__wjMl-M_bAjOkArTjnh8/edit) from you. According to that, you want to build full platform from scratch. It bit differs from building PMS only. That is why we have prepared the estimation for the whole platform and not only for PMS.
Actually prepared estimation based on our experience in developing IGaming platforms you can open on that link : [RAW estimation table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JkbF_t_ULXzwAeY_z4yHkFBLBHZDz83Wx1eourTXQ8Q/edit) 

We split it into two steps. 

First step – things crucial for launching casino. 
The second step is all that you mentioned as not urgent for launch (bonus system engine, for example).

Also, please be aware that the proposed solution is not microservice based, but monolith with services. If you want to stick with microservices – it will take more time/people, but we see no needs for that actually. We suggest avoiding microservices for faster results, and guess it’s optimal for big ( not huge ) products. 

Ifs budget for that project and timeline is suitable for you, we could discuss any details of that, and talk about next steps.

Also, we should mention one more time that for more precious estimation we have to clarify requirements and details – what is crucial, what is nice to have etc. 

We propose to start with gathering business requirements and forming documentation. Based on it, we can do more exact estimations.
