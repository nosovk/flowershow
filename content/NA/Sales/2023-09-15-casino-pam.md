As far we understand from the call you want to build a new platform, targeting mostly LATAM Geo.
We discussed that you want to build Player Management System (CRM for players). Also, you mentioned that we should go online in a year.
We got [that document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iDMjngB6uqM3Zheg8BT8aA__wjMl-M_bAjOkArTjnh8/edit) from you.
According to it, you want to build full platform from scratch. It bit differs from building PAM only.

We dig a bit into our CAS project, which is a fully operating PHP casino platform, and get some [RAW estimation table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15ca5u2l7CqabNHkjlapY6ir3-eVnWM9N50tmqLyG8-Q/edit?usp=sharing) for rewriting it to Go.

We split it into two steps. First step – things crucial for launching casino. The second step is all that you mentioned as not urgent for launch (bonus system engine, for example).

Also, please be aware that the proposed solution is not microservice based, but monolith with services. If you want to stick with microservices – it will take more time/people. We suggest avoiding microservices for faster results.

For more precious estimation we have to clarify requirements – what is crucial, what is nice to have etc. We propose to start with gathering business requirements and forming documentation. Based on it, we can do more exact estimations.
