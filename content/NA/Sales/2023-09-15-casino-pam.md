As far we understand from the call you want to build a new platform, targeting mostly LATAM and Africa Geo.
We discussed that you want to build Player Management System (CRM for players). Also, you mentioned that we should do some MVP in half of the year.
We got [that document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iDMjngB6uqM3Zheg8BT8aA__wjMl-M_bAjOkArTjnh8/edit) from you.
According to it, you want to build full platform from scratch. It bit differs from building PMS only. That is why we have prepared the estimation for the whole platform and not only for PMS. We have prepared the estimation based on our experience in developing Igaming platforms.

We split it into two steps. First step – things crucial for launching casino. The second step is all that you mentioned as not urgent for launch (bonus system engine, for example).

Also, please be aware that the proposed solution is not microservice based, but monolith with services. If you want to stick with microservices – it will take more time/people. We suggest avoiding microservices for faster results.

For more precious estimation we have to clarify requirements – what is crucial, what is nice to have etc. We propose to start with gathering business requirements and forming documentation. Based on it, we can do more exact estimations.
