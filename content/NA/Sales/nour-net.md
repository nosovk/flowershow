### Questions:
- could we obtain access to existing customer panel? We were not able to break throw SMS verification limited to Saudi phone number.
	- Should Provider work only with Saudi citizens, or it should be international service? 
- the main service that we should provide is domain registration?
	- does SA zone registrar provides some test or stage environment to test [EPP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5731.html) integration with them?
- Could we obtain access to existing admin panel?
	- We need to understand how you want to work with prices
	- Also we need to understand, is your current solution based on [WHMCS](https://www.whmcs.com/) or [hostbillapp](hostbillapp.com), or you have some requirements that could not be covered by them and build all from scratch?
