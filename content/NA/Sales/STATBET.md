# Goal
Create Portal with actual info regarding sports
- Soccer
- NBA
- Tennis
at first, and then others — MMA etc.

## Tech
We suggest splitting project to 3 parts.
- Front: this is a part for end users, it uses some API and have aggressive caching, but mostly it's all about our users and UI.
- Admin panel: here we can work with content, tags etc.
- DataPrep: this is a separate service that allows us to fetch data and make some preparation, validation steps, then put that data to DB. Probably could be substituted with n8n node.

### Front
This part uses fully custom design to provide the best user experience. We recommend to use Mobile-First approach in development. To separate external API from app data layer, we propose to use BFF layer (backend for frontend). Here shines [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [CloudFlare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). The main benefit of such stack is a built-in integration of BFF layer into app, which allows using strongly typed autogenerated interface between BFF and frontend. In that case, it's easy to wrap any external API in BFF and decouple its shape from UI. Also, most of the data feed API provided with rate limits for making requests. In case of Cloudflare pages, we can use [KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/) to cache API responses on the edge.
For auth handling, we can use [Lucia](https://lucia-auth.com/getting-started/sveltekit/), which can store auth data inside KV directly (which is easy to implement in our case)
### Admin Panel
We suggest not to build custom admin panel for content. We have to build some interface to manage users, their verifications etc., but it could be done with some ready to go solution. For example [strapi](strapi.io). Strapi is not designed for handling lots of requests, but we anyway have some caching layer at BFF layer. Strapi supports i18n for content. And yes, we have to host it as normal app, without CF Pages. The main goal of using a system like Strapi or [Directus](https://directus.io/) is to avoid building an admin panel ourselves. In it, we can create data scheme with point and click, and then use it as data source.
Danger: before recent there was no way to make normal backups in Strapi, but now there is CLI that allows to make normal backups that store both — schema and data.
### DataPrep
Here we must get some news from API and process them by ChatGPT and other tooling, and then store result in Admin Panel. It could be done as a separate server, but we think that it could be done with low code solution, like [n8n](https://n8n.io). It has [ChatGPT node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/openai/) and some [examples](https://blog.n8n.io/how-to-get-started-with-chatgpt-in-your-n8n-projects-5-simple-workflows/), which are good starting point on understanding how it will be working. Also, n8n has [Strapi node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.strapi/), that means that we could easily store results of processing into Admin Panel (as drafts for start)
