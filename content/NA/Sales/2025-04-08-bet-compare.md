Hi,

Thank you for the [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17FrCT2UoXOE4-0aF62tKV4fXBkuYR0H45zTlFoRFilo/edit?usp=sharing) — we’ve reviewed it. Unfortunately, it doesn’t provide enough information for us to prepare a realistic estimation of the whole project.

For example, we still need answers to several key questions, like screen count, functionality for authorized users, newseller integration etc. These are just a part of the details required for proper planning and estimation.

To move forward, we’d like to propose the following approach:
a Discovery Phase.

During this phase, we will involve a Business Analyst who will hold calls with your team and prepare a detailed technical description along with mockups. Based on this documentation, we will be able to provide an accurate project estimation.

Estimated cost of the Discovery Phase:

Business Analyst: $25/hour × 60 hours = $1,500

Architect (to clarify technical aspects): $50/hour × 5 hours = $250
Total: $1,750

Payment terms:

Pre-payment: $750 before the start of work

Then pay month by month or after end of Discovery phase depends on what will be first.

Let us know what you think about this approach. We believe it will help ensure a smooth and well-planned development process.
