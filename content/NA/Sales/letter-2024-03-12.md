Dear Petteri,

Thank you for taking the time to meet with us—it was a pleasure speaking with you. As a follow-up to our discussion, I’ve outlined some key information about our company and how we can support your projects. You’ll also find our presentation attached for further details.

## About NodeArt

## Key Areas of Expertise:
As discussed in the meeting, here’s how we can assist:
### Mobile Development:
Mostly we stick to cross-platform solutions or PWA.
We primarily use [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and plan to adopt [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/kotlin-multiplatform/) next year or two. Examples of our work include:

[Human.de](https://new.human.de/en) for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/ua/app/human-de/id6471411083), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.human.app)

[Olo.live](https://olo.live/) for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/ua/app/olo-video-chat-people-meet/id6444707043), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.olo.live)

The Olo.live app is particularly relevant to your case, as it includes TensorFlow Mobile for AI-driven nudity detection performed directly on the user’s device rather than server-side. Also, we are now on process of implementing voice recognition functionality within the same approach.

### Network related experience:
We mostly have to worry about network when we have to build network heavy or real-time applications.
For example our team has experience with video broadcasting solutions, including cost optimization by using our own bare metal servers across the globe. Additionally, we are taking part in large-scale video streaming platforms development like (Netflix competitor) by creating solution for generations of individual streams for each client (mostly used to place AD into existing stream). Also we have a few WebRTC based solutions, where we support our own TURN clusters.

### Backend Development:
We specialize in Node.js, Golang, and PHP, leveraging tools like SvelteKit and Hasura for accelerated development. Also, we have lots of tooling that we have integrated, like Metabase, WebLate etc.

### Engagement Models:
We typically work with two models:
- **Outstaffing**: We provide developers with relevant experience to join your team, with management on your side.
- **Outsourcing**: You assign us a scope of work, and we provide an estimation along with an agreed price and terms.

### Pricing

Junior and Markup Developers: $15–$20

Middle Developers: $21–$30

Senior Developers: $31–$42

Team Lead/Architects: $43–$55

Senior DevOps: $50–$55

Rates depend on years of experience and specific technologies.

We’re confident that our skills and experience align with your needs, and we look forward to discussing how we can collaborate further. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or require additional information.

Best regards,
