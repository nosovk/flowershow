### Goal: clarify what should be done

At current moment, Conrad wants to build an MVP product. It should be an application, that we can deploy on web. This application should consist of 3 parts.
- Game Engine Backend: This will serve as a seamless wallet API to manage game sessions. It will also have uncertified math to produce game outcomes..
- Game Frontend: The user interface for the slot game
- Game Launcher: A small website that allows for the launch of a single game using "FUN" currency.

These three parts will be published on the internet. A tablet or PC in a local venue will run the game launcher in kiosk mode, allowing visitors to test the game.

### Out of Scope for the Prototype
- Game Math: We will be using math that is not certifiable for regulatory purposes
- Local System Setup: We will not provide a system for local installation in a venue. The prototype will be an online slot game, although it could potentially be packaged for a local environment in the future.
- Progressive Jackpot: A progressive jackpot will not be implemented in this MVP.

We need confirmation, that we clearly understood what should be done, and it's what you are seeking now.
