### App structure
App contains 3 modules: web app, server, strapi.

#### WebApp
It's a web application with TG context integration. We use [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction) to build fast and robust app. Also, it's much smaller than typical SPA.
#### Server
It's a [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en) server build with [fastify](https://fastify.dev/). It allows us to handle lots of requests. Because of the nature of an app our backend works within 2 different storage engines. [Redis](https://redis.io) KV as a user database, where we store current values. Also, we make use of [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery?hl=en) to store history of balance updates etc.
#### CMS
As an admin panel we use [strapi](https://strapi.io), it's a pretty solid instrument to provide user-friendly admin panel to customers. Here you can control TG invites, math etc.
#### BI
Because all historical data stored in BQ, you can easily make reports\dashboards in any BI system. If [Metabase](https://metabase.com) is ok for you â€” we can setup it for you.

### Infrastructure
WebApp deployed to CloudFlare pages. Assets from Strapi deployed to CloudFlare R2. You will have to pay for CloudFlare services.
Server and CMS deployed to dedicated server in a docker swarm cluster. We have to rent a server for that. In common we usually stick to [OVH.ie](https://fastify.dev/), if its ok - you will have to pass KYC there and we will be able to deploy there.
Stage-Prod: there will be 2 environments (stage and prod). Be aware that they will not sync automaticaly.
