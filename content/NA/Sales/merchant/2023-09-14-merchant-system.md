# Goal
Clarify what product you want to build.

From the first glance I thought that you want to build merchant platform. The flow that I described during the call:
- user register
- user must pass KYC (Know You Customer)
- user gets access to cabinet and API
- users integrates payment form at his site
- customers pay to service users using payment form
- we charge customer cards and put money to user's account (and charge our commission)
- we make payouts to users bank account upon request.

But according to doc above, you need something bit different. 
The software you provided as an example is a white label solution for [ISO â€“ independent sales organization](https://stripe.com/it/resources/more/independent-sales-organizations)
It means that you target existing ISO, they register at your platform, sign contract with a bank, and operate with bank using yours system. Am I correct?

In common, it means that yours platform is a gate to different banks (with whom ISO must sign contract separately).
But I don't understand which services you want to provide to ISO.
- CRM system for ISO to track their customer's
- payment gateway to process card payments
- payment hardware to process cards offsite?


In case you work as a proxy to bank you don't need to build tokenizer, bank provides you with everything. You still have to acquire PCI DSS, but with a smaller scope.
But you will have to build something to bring additional value to users. I need to clarify what exactly you want to provide on top of card processing, because your fee will be bigger than at a classical merchant provider (but you have no need to buy a licensee)
