We would like to transfer data from platform to web analytics service. We have no final decision about web analytics, that's why we would like to take a bet on [Google Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com/), which allows us to make some sophisticated abstraction.

GTM installs as a script on a page, that could be lazy loaded.

From frontend part we have to install to kinds of snippets.

### Data Snippet
Upon app load, we have to populate user attributes in a DataLayer. For example like that:
```javascript
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
window.dataLayer.push({
 'uid': '32131', // user id of visitor
 'language': 'ru', // language
 'registrationDate': 23131323 // timestamp of registratoin date\time
 });
```
That snippet is a fail safe, if GTM is blocked by ADBlock it will not cause web to fail.
### Event Snippet
When we want to pass event into analytics we should push data within a special key `event`.
```javascript
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
window.dataLayer.push({
 'event': 'deposit_event', // event name
 'eventCategory': 'deposit', // event category for Google Analytics
 'eventAction': 'start', // event action for Google Analytics
 'eventValue': 'USDT', // event value for Google Analytics
 });
```
Keys except event are optional, but it's easy to handle them using a common handler at GTM side.

> Be aware that `user_id` is a special param, that used across all events to attribute any data or event to user. There is NO SESSIONS in GA4, each event should be directly attributed, without that there is no use of data inside GTM.
