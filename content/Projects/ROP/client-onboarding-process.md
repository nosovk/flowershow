## Env Setup
- We ask to buy 2 domains. One domain used for client side, second domain used for API and Admin Panel. We insist on splitting admin and client side.
For example: my-real-casino.com and my-secret-admin.com
- After providing domain names, we will provide NS servers that you should use for those domains.
- After domains settled on Cloudflare  account, we can start environment creation.
- Google Cloud Setup: we have to store audit logs of all bets and client profile modification, and we should store that data in yours account. Please register account, add project, and share ownership rope over that project to dev@nodeart.io
## RLS Colors
- You can choose one of existing RLS themes, or you can [build your own (video guide)](https://youtu.be/QCfXKaZYKYc).

- if you have some branding docs, show them to us
- or you can just draw some design from scratch, respecting url structure that exists in example.

## Docs
- we ask for text, for T&C page, and Privacy page
### Translations
- If you want to have some language that differs from English, we will ask you to upload translations. We use [weblate](https://weblate.org/) to manage translations
