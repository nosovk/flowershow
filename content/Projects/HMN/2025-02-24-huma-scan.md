There are a few obstacles, that could significantly affect delivery timeline. Because of that I suggest to make some MVP, that will cover quirky questions.
## MVP
- integrate Tauti with scanner
- convert xml with rules to internal rules
- detect contracts according to xml config


### Tech part
For building an app we want to use [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/), which is a mix of web and desktop solution. We are going to make Windows build. Inside we gonna use Svelte to build an interface.


### Reasoning
There is no build in TWAIN support in Tauri or Electron ([issue](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/11289)). Because of that, we have to build some interop. There are commonly used tools, like [cmdtwain](https://www.gssezisoft.com/main/cmdtwain/) for cases like that, but no ready to go integration. That's why we think that is crucial to test that case.

We got access to XML's with data, on how to parse results, but to confirm that everything is correct, we have to convert xml's to jsons, and try to analyze sets of prepared results. If all results match with original software â€” then we are succeeded.

## Estimation
We think that all quirk questions could be checked in first month. If yes - we can make a full solution and will make more precise integration on whole project.
