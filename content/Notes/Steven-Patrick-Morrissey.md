Steven Patrick Morrissey, born on May 22, 1959, in Davyhulme, Manchester, England, is an influential English singer and songwriter best known as the frontman and lyricist of the iconic rock band The Smiths. The band, formed in 1982 with guitarist Johnny Marr, became a defining force in the indie rock scene until their breakup in 1987. Morrissey’s lyrics often explore themes of emotional isolation, sexual longing, and social criticism, marked by his distinctive baritone voice and sardonic wit.

## Early Life and Career

Morrissey was raised in a working-class family; his parents were Irish immigrants. He developed an early passion for literature and music, influenced by figures such as Oscar Wilde and David Bowie. Before forming **The Smiths**, he was briefly involved with the punk band **The Nosebleeds** and worked as a music journalist

## The Smiths Era

The Smiths released four studio albums: *The Smiths* (1984), *Meat Is Murder* (1985), *The Queen Is Dead* (1986), and *Strangeways*, *Here We Come* (1987). Their music gained critical acclaim but never achieved mainstream success in the U.S., where they became cult favorites. The band's breakup stemmed from personal differences between Morrissey and Marr, leading to Morrissey's transition to a solo career.

## Naming The Smiths  
The name "The Smiths" was chosen by Morrissey as a reaction against bands with pretentious names. He suggested several options, including "Smiths Family," before settling on "The Smiths" with guitarist Johnny Marr
